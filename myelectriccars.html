	<h2>Why you should buy an EV</h2>

		<p><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/history-electric-car"style="font-size: 18px"target="_blank">Electric Vehicles</a> started mass producing in the 1970's, and have only got better since. With the rising gasoline prices, and carbon dioxide in the air, a cleaner alternative will be needed very soon. That alternative is an electric vehicle. While an EV may cost more than the average spender may want to spend on a car, you will gain back that money overtime, and be helping out the environment at the same time. <br><br>EV's only need about $14.40 to fill up completely, while a normal gasoline car will cost about $32.76 to fill up completely. This means that you will save about $18.36 every time that you recharge the car. This means that in 1 year, you will have saved about $706 per year. So depending on the electric vehicle that you buy, with enough time you will save a lot of money.</p>
